    "Which music genre exhibits the strongest positive and negative associations with a person’s mental health profile, specifically across self-reported Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia scores on a 0-10 scale? \n",
    "\n",
    "This project makes use of statistical inference to determine if identifying a specific genre as one’s favorite and its average bpm correlates with significantly higher or lower mental health scores. By controlling age and hours of daily listening, we will isolate the relationship between musical preference and mental health to ensure that we are strictly analyzing the correlation between the two. This analysis aims to uncover whether certain genre preferences can be used as indicators of psychological distress patterns.  "

    "Mental health among college students has become an increasingly urgent public health concern, anxiety, depression, and chronic stress rates being reported in recent years. In a 2024 report by the American College Health Association, 60% of college students reported overwhelming anxiety while another portion reported being functionally limited due to depression [1]. The research topic is necessary to see how college students utilize music as a low-barrier mental health service to cope with the daily stressors of life. Many college students do not seek formal mental health resources due to monetary constraints and the stigma around these struggles, and music has emerged as a unique outlet for emotional regulation. Listening to music has transformed from passive listening to an active tool for stress management and crisis aversion. Furthermore, identifying the relationship between music genres and mental health can provide insights into how different musical content can either contribute to or detract from mental health struggles when used as a tool for self-remedy. In recent years, studies have shown that music is beneficial to students with high stress levels. For example, a 2025 study titled “Statistical Insights into the Influence of Music on Mental Health” highlights the impact of musical engagement on psychological well-being by giving quantitative evidence [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike therapy or medication, music requires no appointment, no cost, and no disclosure. Music is a low-barrier outlet for students, as it is already embedded in their daily life. The use of music as an emotional regulator serves as a prompt for researchers to look beyond music as entertainment but rather a legitimate coping mechanism. A thesis from the University of Guelph by Parya Abadeh argues that while music is a regular tool for emotional processing, the type of engagement determines whether the outcome is beneficial or not. Abadeh explains that “certain songs-especially those with negative or ambiguous emotional content- can reinforce rumination and other maladaptive emotion-regulation patterns, ultimately elevating stress…” [3]. While this study affirms that music listening broadly correlates with positive mental health outcomes, it treats musical engagement as a relatively uniform behavior, leaving open the question of whether what students listen to matters as much as the fact that they are listening at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the correlation between them is debated profusely, especially regarding certain genres of music and their levels of emotional intensity and calmness. A 2022 study by Kuo Wang, Sunyu Gao, and Jianhao Huang titled “Learning About Your Mental Health From Your Playlist? Investigating the Correlation Between Music Preference and Mental Health of College Students” found that preference for the pop music genre indicated less reported mental health struggles while heavy music preference showed an inverse relationship. Their results indicated the “correlation was significant and positive between pop music and mental health.” [4] They also observed a “significant and inverse relationship between college students’ preference for heavy music and their mental health”. [4] These findings are compelling, but leave some questions unanswered, since it remains unclear whether genre preference has a causative or consequential relationship to psychological stress patterns. Additionally, it is also unclear whether listening frequency of certain genres can play a role in regulating or destabilizing mental health struggles. With these posed questions, this project aims to address these gaps by holistically examining the relationship between student listening habits and mental health struggles to see how music can be utilized as a tool or deterrent for these emotional hardships.\n",

    "We hypothesize that high BPM genres such as Rock or Metal will show a significant positive correlation with ‘high arousal’ symptoms, specifically Anxiety and Insomnia scores. We further predict that Depression scores will be high across both extremes of tempo in genres reflecting people’s different coping strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fast auditory stimuli can increase heart rate and can potentially cause restlessness, making it harder to fall asleep. For this reason, we believe that high BPM music would cause more anxiety and insomnia. Additionally, people usually listen to music that reflects their current mood. Therefore, someone with Depression might listen to slow music to reflect their sadness, or they might pick faster, louder music as a way to let out frustration. \n"

    "### Dataset: Music & Mental Health Results\n",
    "1. The dataset “Music & Mental Health Survey Results” main independent variable is “Fav genre”, a variable that represents the respondent’s favorite music style, such as Rock, Pop, Metal, etc. To measure daily listening time for music, we use “Hours per day” to quantify in hours. Our dependent variables are “Anxiety”, “Depression”, and “Insomnia”. They are self-reported scores measured on a scale from 0 to 10. 0 indicates no symptoms of said variable, while 10 indicates extreme symptoms. Although these are highly subjective, higher scores indicate significant distress. We are also utilizing age in years as a control variable to find generational trends that could skew our results. We are also utilizing “BPM” to test if faster tempos correlate with high arousal. To specify, there are 736 observations and 33 variables.\n",
    "2. There are several concerns about this dataset. The data does not have a large sample size (n = 736), especially for the older population, due to the distribution via online forums. There are genres that could have too few observations for us to figure out significant results. The self-reported scores are highly subjective because they are not clinically assessed. For example, one respondent’s specific score could be another’s lower score.\n",

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have considered that the first data set on music and mental Health survey might have selection bias because of the fact that it was shared on reddit, discord, and social media. These are mostly platforms that younger people tend to use. This means that the older generations might not be accurately represented. To address this, we will use Age as a control variable to see if mental scores are being driven by age or taste in music. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Usually, Kaggle datasets are de-identified, but we are still aware that there might be PIIs in the dataset. To minimize the risk of re-identification, we would only really work with variables that are relevant to the dataset and drop all the variables that are not. Additionally, we would analyze data in groups rather than looking at individual cases to ensure that no single person’s mental health profile is highlighted. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have considered that our results could be used to stereotype certain music fanatics. For example, for music listeners with high-energy music, such as Metal could be seen as more anxious or unstable than lower-energy music listeners. We will mitigate this by specifically mentioning that we are only looking at the correlations between variables and not causation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Even though the data is on a public domain, it contains information that could be considered sensitive. We would store the data and working files on password-protected devices and use private repositories that prevent unauthorized third parties. This would allow us to reduce the risk of data leaks. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> We will be using the data given to us only for the duration of the project which allows us to minimize long-term risk. This means that we will delete all of the local files of the Kaggle dataset after the final project is finished. Also by deleting this data, we eliminate the risk of future data leaks and unauthorized use of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> To address blindspots in the analysis, we acknowledge the limitations posed by this dataset, since we cannot draw data from real individuals experiencing mental health struggles directly. To combat this, we will frame findings as correlational patterns and challenge our assumptions by testing alternative explanations, such as reverse causation. We also acknowledge that our samples are primarily WEIRD samples (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich Democratic), entailing that the findings may not be generalizable to music-mental health relationships for all individuals. To address this shortcoming, we will frame our conclusions cautiously and describe findings as correlations that require validation within the target communities.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some possible sources of biases in our data can arise from the survey distribution protocols, as the survey used to collect this data was posted on social media forums, such as Reddit. This can overrepresent younger populations with high tech literacy and could incline music enthusiasts to complete the music-oriented survey. Additionally, these mental health struggles are self-reported and do not consider the clinical diagnoses an individual actually has, entailing that the results cannot be generalizable to clinically diagnosed populations. To combat these, we can analyze the findings by age groups to check if correlational relationships are present across all demographics. Additionally, within our findings, we can acknowledge categories such as depression and anxiety are self-perceived by the reporter and are not clinically diagnosed symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will strive to honestly represent the underlying data through including error bars within visualizations to show possible variance. Additionally, we will ensure our data visualizations are not truncated to make our findings more extreme and overexaggerated. Additionally, we will also include effect sizes, such as correlational strength, with p-values for readers to better identify the statistical significance of our data. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, the dataset we are utilizing does not contain PII’s since all participants were anonymous in the original data collection.  \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, all processes will be documented with clear comments explaining our code. Additionally, we will utilize a README page to explain where our data originates from and how to access it to run this analysis.\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies that are unfairly discriminatory since irrelevant demographic variables, including race, gender, sexuality, etc. are not being utilized as metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will check whether correlations hold true across all age groups and report any discrepancies we identify. When conducting the analysis, we will also acknowledge if a certain group is underrepresented and how the generalization of our findings will be impacted from this.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, for additional metrics, we plan to use correlation coefficients to measure relationships between variables and also check linear and ranked correlations to ensure we are not missing any relevant patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, we intend to utilize correlations that are easy to interpret and complement our findings with data visualizations to make our findings understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will communicate the shortcomings and biases by having a dedicated section in our final report communicating relevant limitations, such as possible biases from data collection, overrepresented demographics, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will monitor our impact by ensuring that the report was based on a relatively small, self-reported sample. Additionally, the results should not be used for medical advice or general assumptions about a listener of a specific genre. This reduces the risk of misinterpretation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> To address potential future harm, we will add a feedback section in our final report. If our findings have irrelevant correlations or a particular community feels unfairly represented, we can update our conclusion based on the feedback. We will correct any misinterpretations that might be identified during the peer review process or by feedback from people viewing our project. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The unintended use of our model would be when people use our results to \"self-diagnose\" themselves. To prevent this, we will include a medical disclaimer saying that the results are for educational purposes only and to seek professional medical advice if needed. Creating this boundary would likely prevent any abuse of the model. "
